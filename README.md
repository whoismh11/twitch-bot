# Twitch Bot
GAMEGG [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) robot.

## How to use
1. First, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Go to the bot folder and open the `bot.js` file with notepad and enter your desired details instead of the three parts `BOT_USERNAME`, `OAUTH_TOKEN` and `CHANNEL_NAME` and save the changes.
- `BOT_USERNAME`: Username of the bot account (you can introduce your account and the bot will send a message on your behalf or create a new account for your bot).
- `OAUTH_TOKEN`: You must get and enter this token from [this link](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
- `CHANNEL_NAME`: You must enter your channel name instead (for example `gamegg_ir`).
3. Go to the bot folder, then hold down the "Shift" key and "right-click" on the empty space inside the folder and select `open command window here` or `open PowerShell window here` (You can also reach the bot folder using cmd and `cd` command).
4. In the window that opens, type this text and press enter: `node bot.js`
5. If the message `connected` is displayed, your bot is successfully online and usable.

- To add, delete or edit bot commands, go to the `// Called every time a message comes in` section in the `bot.js` file and apply the commands you want.
